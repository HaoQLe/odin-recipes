    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This quick and easy breakfast omelette recipe is perfect for a cozy morning. It combines fluffy, seasoned eggs with your choice of fresh fillings like cheese, veggies, or ham, all folded into a warm, delicious omelette</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li> 1-2 tbsp milk or water (optional, for fluffiness)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter or oil</li>
        <li>Your choice of fillings (e.g., shredded cheese, diced ham, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, spinach)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and pepper, and whisk until well combined. Add a splash of milk or water for a fluffier texture.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add butter or oil and let it melt, coating the pan evenly.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan, swirling it gently to spread it evenly across the bottom.</li>
        <li>Once the edges start to set but the middle is still a bit runny, add your desired fillings on one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the fillings. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the eggs are fully set, then slide the omelette onto a plate.</li>
    </ol>
