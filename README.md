This website is a basic recipe website to practice HTML basics.

In this project, I practiced using the HTML boiler plate for each page. I learned to use different HTML elements such as headers, paragraphs, images,
anchors, and lists.

After revisiting this project, I have applied CSS selectors to add colors and new styles to my website.
